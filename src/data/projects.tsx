      overview: `Sea Clouds was proud to support the execution of the Baltica 2 Offshore Wind Farm, 
                 one of the largest offshore renewable energy investments in the Baltic Sea. 
                 Our involvement began in May 2025 and continues throughout the execution phase, 
                 focusing on the shore crossing section prepared using Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD). 
  
                 The initial scope (May–June 2025) focused on documentation and operational readiness, 
                 enabling the safe start of offshore works. From mid-2025 until February 2026, 
                 we continue to provide technical and HSE advisory support during ongoing HDD activities.`,
